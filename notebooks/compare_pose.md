# ü§ñ Pose Estimation Comparison: MediaPipe vs YOLOv8

## üéØ Goal

Compare two pose estimation frameworks ‚Äî MediaPipe and YOLOv8 ‚Äî on short workout videos to evaluate:
- FPS performance
- Keypoint precision
- Stability under movement
- Behavior when limbs are occluded or in edge cases

---

## üß™ Test Setup

- 3 workout videos: 1 with squats, 2 with push-ups
- Good lighting, full-body visibility, no visual noise
- Same hardware and processing pipeline for both models
- Keypoints were saved to CSV for comparison, annotated videos were generated for visual inspection

## üèÅ Conclusion

MediaPipe outperforms YOLOv8 in all critical areas for exercise repetition analysis:
- Delivers higher FPS and smoother keypoint tracking
- Maintains body part tracking even during occlusions or fast motion
- Produces richer keypoint data (x, y, z + confidence)

YOLOv8 may still be useful as a lighter alternative or for quick setups, but for this MVP, **MediaPipe is clearly the better choice** for accurate and stable pose estimation.
